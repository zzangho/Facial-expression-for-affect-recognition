  * [Affect Detection: An Interdisciplinary Review of Models, Methods, and Their Applications](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5520655/), Rafael A. Calvo, Sidney D'Mello, 2010: Emotion recognition papers are classified into modalities (biosignals, facial expressions, voices) used in emotion recognition, and the recognition methods of each modality are investigated.
